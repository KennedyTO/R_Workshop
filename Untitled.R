# Assignment: day 03: Instructions

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# You are a researcher interested in understanding the variables 
# that predict science literacy of 15 year-old students worldwide.
# You are confident that the variables found in the PISA2015
# dataset can help you predict the science literacy score.
# From your previous study, you know that "REPEAT" is one
# variable that may predict the science literacy score.


# I would like you to add anothre variable from the PISA2015
# and build a multiple regression model to test if the results
# support your hypothesis.


# After building the model, provide your interpretation of the
# results and a visual representation of the outcome.


# When coding, please ensure to provide a short description
# of your code each time (See expamples below). Please also
# use "#" to comment your code and separate the text from
# the code.


# Example 1:
# Load the PISA2015 dataset and name it "pisa" :
# pisa <- read.csv("abcd.csv")

# Example 2:
# Change variabl name from ABC to DEF and name it "cleaned":
# cleaned <- pisa %>% rename(DEF = ABC)


# Your task is to complete the following steps:
#----------------------------------------------------------


# 1) Select an additional variables from the PISA2015 dataset 
# that you think may predict the science literacy score of 
# 15 year-old students and build a hypothesis. Please ensure
# to include the "REPEAT" variable in your hypothesis.


# e.g., "REPEAT" and "Age" will predict science literacy 
# score of 15 year-old students.


# (Your hypothesis here)




# 2) Following the steps provided in the workshop, clean the
# data and provide a descipritive statistics of the variables
# you selected. Ensure to include "REPEAT" variable in your
# statistics.

# Note: 

# Please ensure to provide a short description on your code
# each time you write a new line of code.

# e.g.

# Load the PISA2015 dataset
# pisa <- read.csv("abcd.csv")

# 



# 3) Provide a scatter plot, pearson correlation, and density
# plot of the variables you selected. You may use ggpairs()
# function from the GGally package to create the matrix.





# 4) Build a multiple regression model to test your hypothesis.
