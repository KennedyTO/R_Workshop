# Assignment: day 03: Instructions

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# You are a researcher interested in understanding the variables 
# that predict the science literacy of 15-year-old students worldwide.
# You are confident that the variables in the PISA 2015 dataset 
# can help you predict the science literacy scores.
# From your previous study, you know that "REPEAT" is one 
# variable that may predict the science literacy score.


### GENERAL REQUIREMENT ###
# I would like you to add another variable of your choice from 
# the PISA 2015 dataset and build a multiple regression model 
# to test if the results from your multiple linear regression 
# support your hypothesis.


# Please follow the steps below and provide your interpretation 
# of your model as well as any visual aids you make.


# When coding, ensure you provide a brief description 
# of your code (see examples below). Use "#" to comment 
# on your code and separate the text from the R code. 
# R code does not require the "#" symbol before it.

# Example 1:
# Always explain your intention before writing your code.

# e.g.,
# Load the PISA2015 dataset and name it "pisa" :
# pisa <- read.csv("abcd.csv")


# Example 2:
# Comments and R code should be separated by adding and 
# removing the "#" symbol.

# e.g.,
# Change variable name from ABC to DEF and name it "cleaned":
# cleaned <- pisa %>% rename(DEF = ABC)


### VERY IMPORTANT ###
# Please make sure to save your work frequently by clicking 
# on the "Save" button to the top left of the script editor 
# and avoid losing your work.


#### ASSIGNMENT 03 ####

# 1) Select an additional variables from the PISA2015 dataset 
# that you think may predict the science literacy score of 
# 15 year-old students and build a hypothesis. Please ensure
# to include the "REPEAT" variable in your hypothesis.


# e.g., "REPEAT" and "Age" will predict science literacy 
# score of 15 year-old students.


# (Your hypothesis here)


# 2) Following the steps provided in the workshop, clean the
# data and provide a descriptive statistics of the variables
# you selected. Ensure to include "REPEAT" variable in your
# statistics.


# (Your code here)



# 3) Provide a scatter plot, Pearson correlation, and density
# plot of the variables you selected. You may use the ggpairs()
# function from the GGally package to create the matrix.

# 4) Build a multiple regression model to test your hypothesis
# and print your summary.
